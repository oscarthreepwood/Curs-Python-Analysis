2
00:00:05.631 --> 00:00:11.272
In this video, we will model stock
return using normal random variable and

3
00:00:11.272 --> 00:00:17.195
demonstrate the importance of distribution
in identifying financial risk.

4
00:00:17.195 --> 00:00:22.625
Why it is important to know the
distribution or model for stock return.

5
00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:25.468
It is really crucial in risk management.

6
00:00:25.468 --> 00:00:30.175
For example,
the stock price of Apple drop over 40%

7
00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:35.202
from August 2012 to May 2013,
roughly one year.

8
00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:39.663
We need to compute what's the chance
that the yearly return can

9
00:00:39.663 --> 00:00:41.864
be less than negative 40%.

10
00:00:41.864 --> 00:00:46.777
Is that possible, or
just an extreme case like black swan.

11
00:00:46.777 --> 00:00:51.560
We compute log daily return for
stock price of Apple.

12
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.149
The histogram of a return is symmetric and
bell shaped,

13
00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.065
which is very similar
to normal distribution.

14
00:01:00.065 --> 00:01:04.749
Using scipy which is a scientific
computation package of python,

15
00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:09.701
we can get density function and
a cumulative distribution function.

16
00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:12.473
norm.pdf where a given density for

17
00:01:12.473 --> 00:01:16.360
each possible value of
a normal random variable.

18
00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.660
In fact normal random
variable can take values from

19
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.262
positive infinity to negative infinity.

20
00:01:24.262 --> 00:01:30.889
In Python code here, we get the density
between -4 and 4 for simplicity.

21
00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:34.779
Two parameters 0, 1 in
norm.pdf gives the mean and

22
00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:38.860
the standard deviation of
a normal random variable.

23
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.872
This normal random variable is also
called a standard normal random variable,

24
00:01:43.872 --> 00:01:47.406
and its distribution is
also called z-distribution.

25
00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:53.830
You can change these two values in order
to get a different normal variables.

26
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.772
Because, the density functions of
a normal variables are only related

27
00:01:58.772 --> 00:02:01.171
to their mean and their variance.

28
00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:05.369
We also can get a cumulative
distribution function, or

29
00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.014
in short a CDF which outputs
the probability for the area, and

30
00:02:10.014 --> 00:02:12.709
lower side of each possible value.

31
00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.361
On the left side of this slide
is the graph for normal density,

32
00:02:17.361 --> 00:02:20.860
symmetric with a mean and
symmetric center.

33
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.891
It is also bell shaped.

34
00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:27.429
On the right side that is
cumulative distribution function,

35
00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:29.533
where x takes large values.

36
00:02:29.533 --> 00:02:33.203
The cumulative probability
will approach 1.

37
00:02:33.203 --> 00:02:37.712
We can model daily stock return
using normal distribution.

38
00:02:37.712 --> 00:02:43.207
We do not know the real mean and standard
deviation of this normal random variable.

39
00:02:43.207 --> 00:02:47.629
We have a large collection of
data return from historic data.

40
00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.124
We can compute the mean and
the standard deviation in this collection.

41
00:02:52.124 --> 00:02:56.161
They are not the same as
those of normal variable, but

42
00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:59.401
close enough, as this shown on the right.

43
00:02:59.401 --> 00:03:03.563
Then, what is the chance data
loss can be more than 5%?

44
00:03:03.563 --> 00:03:10.054
First, we will plot the normal
density curve for this daily return.

45
00:03:10.054 --> 00:03:16.097
This pink area is the probability
of losing more than 5% in one day.

46
00:03:16.097 --> 00:03:22.221
We can use CDF to get this probability,
which is 0.5%.

47
00:03:22.221 --> 00:03:29.503
Hence we have 0.5% chance to
have a daily loss more than 5%.

48
00:03:29.503 --> 00:03:34.975
Our goal is to find out how
likely that the stock price of Apple

49
00:03:34.975 --> 00:03:40.997
were dropped over 40%,
1 year which has 220 trading days.

50
00:03:40.997 --> 00:03:45.707
We will use another normal
distribution to model yearly return.

51
00:03:45.707 --> 00:03:51.392
We need to figure out the mean and
the standard deviation of a yearly return.

52
00:03:51.392 --> 00:03:55.378
We make assumption that
the daily returns are independent,

53
00:03:55.378 --> 00:03:56.790
which is quite wrong.

54
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.695
But it can simplify our discussion here,

55
00:03:59.695 --> 00:04:02.851
to get the mean and
variance of a year return.

56
00:04:02.851 --> 00:04:06.487
We have formulas for sum of variables.

57
00:04:06.487 --> 00:04:10.101
We need the independence when
we compute the variance.

58
00:04:10.101 --> 00:04:15.878
If the data returns independent
the variance of a unit return

59
00:04:15.878 --> 00:04:20.900
is equal to the sum of
a variance of 220 daily return.

60
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.348
Again, with no CDF we compute
a probability, and it is less than 2%.

61
00:04:27.348 --> 00:04:32.322
That implies,
there's only less than 2% chance to have

62
00:04:32.322 --> 00:04:35.373
yearly loss to be more than 40%.

63
00:04:35.373 --> 00:04:39.793
What happened to Apple in 2012 and 2013?

64
00:04:39.793 --> 00:04:44.596
Is not consistent with
its overall performance.

65
00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:46.325
In many circumstances,

66
00:04:46.325 --> 00:04:50.782
we need to solve a different type
of problem with distribution.

67
00:04:50.782 --> 00:04:55.949
For example, finding quantiles of
a normal distribution is a common task

68
00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:00.881
when performing statistical test
in the financial risk management.

69
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:06.072
Normal distribution quantiles
can obtain using norm.ppf.

70
00:05:06.072 --> 00:05:09.914
Ppf stands for percent point function.

71
00:05:09.914 --> 00:05:13.914
In finance related to
the quantile there is

72
00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:18.146
an important risk measure
value of risk or VaR.

73
00:05:18.146 --> 00:05:25.398
It estimates how much a set of investments
might lose with a given probability.

74
00:05:25.398 --> 00:05:31.008
VaR is typically used by firms and
the regulators in the financial

75
00:05:31.008 --> 00:05:37.236
industry to gauge the amount of
assess needed to cover possible loss.

76
00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:42.248
For example,
5% of quantile of daily return is

77
00:05:42.248 --> 00:05:47.272
called a 95% VaR or
VaR at the level of 95%.

78
00:05:47.272 --> 00:05:53.780
We can use a ppf to get a 5% of
quantile which is negative 0.03.

79
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:58.112
hence, 95% of VaR is negative 0.03,

80
00:05:58.112 --> 00:06:04.959
it means with the 5% chance that
daily return is worse than -3%.

81
00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:09.367
Is it safe to use normal
description to model stock return?

82
00:06:09.367 --> 00:06:13.967
Two famous professors in
the field asset pricing, Fama and

83
00:06:13.967 --> 00:06:16.269
French responds in this way.

84
00:06:16.269 --> 00:06:20.037
Distribution of a daily and
monthly stock return,

85
00:06:20.037 --> 00:06:25.042
are rather symmetric about their means,
but the tails are fatter.

86
00:06:25.042 --> 00:06:29.748
Which means there are more
outliers that would be

87
00:06:29.748 --> 00:06:33.546
expected with normal distributions.

88
00:06:33.546 --> 00:06:37.027
It means that, if tail returns negative,

89
00:06:37.027 --> 00:06:41.774
as well as positive,
may occur more often than we expect.

90
00:06:41.774 --> 00:06:47.003
If we use normal distribution,
this is debatable,

91
00:06:47.003 --> 00:06:53.264
at least for the returns of some assets
with different time window size.

92
00:06:53.264 --> 00:06:57.200
To modal a fat tail,
people proposed modal return using

93
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.561
t-distributions with
low degree of freedom.

94
00:07:00.561 --> 00:07:05.209
We will discuss and use t-distribution
in the next several topics.
