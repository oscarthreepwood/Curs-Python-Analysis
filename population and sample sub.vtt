00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:06.792
In this video,

3
00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:12.980
we are going to discuss basic
concepts about population and sample.

4
00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.870
Population is a group of individuals
who have something in common.

5
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:23.040
We may be interested in some
properties about a certain group,

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.998
which we call target population,
that cannot be observed completely.

7
00:00:28.998 --> 00:00:33.665
For example,
all registered voters in Thailand, or

8
00:00:33.665 --> 00:00:39.163
all Hong Kong citizens who played
golf at least once past year,

9
00:00:39.163 --> 00:00:41.980
or all neurons from your brain.

10
00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.616
Since we cannot get information for
every individual of these populations,

11
00:00:48.616 --> 00:00:52.760
we have to take sample,
which is a part of target population.

12
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.990
Sample is a small group of population.

13
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.880
It is a representative of the population,
hence, it has to be randomly selected.

14
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.220
This process is called random sampling.

15
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.700
There are two kinds of sampling,
called a sampling without replacement, or

16
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.140
with replacement, depending on
whether you put the select individuals

17
00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.780
back into population before
you select the next one.

18
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.320
In a sampling without replacement,

19
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.280
an individual is randomly
selected from the population.

20
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.040
The next individual will be selected

21
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.520
without putting the previous
individual back.

22
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.550
Every individual is selected
from a different pool.

23
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.620
If the population size is very large,
this method is a factor

24
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.620
because it can generate a random
sample with different individuals.

25
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.310
There is another kind of sampling method,
sampling with replacement.

26
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.020
A randomly selected
individual will be put back

27
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.130
before the next individual being selected.

28
00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.580
Hence, it is possible that the same
individual can be selected more than once.

29
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.070
When the population is small,
this method can make sure that

30
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.150
everyone in the population has
the same chance being selected.

31
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.660
In this example,
we first create a blank DataFrame and

32
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.670
we create a new column in this DataFrame.

33
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.620
Name the column as Population.

34
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.900
Then I run this python code to
perform sampling from the population

35
00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.160
by drawing five individuals
randomly without replacement.

36
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.624
And stored them,
as a_sample_without_replacement.

37
00:02:51.624 --> 00:02:57.000
In we can use method
sample to get samples.

38
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.370
Here, the key word replace=False

39
00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.979
means the sampling is
a sampling without replacement.

40
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.810
We can define replace True to
perform sampling with replacement.

41
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.280
Here are the results of two samples.

42
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.500
You can see that for
sampling without replacement,

43
00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.731
which is on the left-hand side,
there are no duplicates individuals found.

44
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:34.271
As we can see, there are no
duplicate index numbers either.

45
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:40.178
However, on the right-hand side,
which is the sampling with replacement,

46
00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:45.469
it is possible to see the same
individual is drawn for multiple times.

47
00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:52.760
Besides population sample, there is
another pair of concepts, parameter and

48
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:58.720
statistics, of which are very important
in categorizing population and sample.

49
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.360
Parameter is a characteristic or
summary number of populations.

50
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.158
Statistic is a characteristic or
summary number of sample.

51
00:04:07.158 --> 00:04:10.550
For example, mean,

52
00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.060
variance, standard deviation of population
are characteristics of population.

53
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.540
Once target populations are fixed,
these summary numbers will not change.

54
00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.360
Sample also has mean, variance,
and standard deviation,

55
00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.590
but their values changes
in different samples,

56
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.040
even if they are drawn
from the same population.

57
00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.140
Let's print out the parameters of
population which we have just created.

58
00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:46.181
We can calculate the mean,
variance, and the standard

59
00:04:46.181 --> 00:04:51.948
deviation using dataframe methods,
.mean, .var, .std.

60
00:04:51.948 --> 00:04:55.540
The mathematic formulas for
mean and variance are given.

61
00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:03.434
In calculating var and std,
we set the keyword ddof as 0.

62
00:05:03.434 --> 00:05:08.020
Which means the denominator of
the population variance is N,

63
00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.942
which is the number of the population.

64
00:05:10.942 --> 00:05:14.679
The .shape,
as described in the previous module,

65
00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:18.890
offers a size of the data
frame in rows and columns.

66
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.550
We use .shape(0) to display
only the number of rows.

67
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:31.020
Also, these methods can be applied
to compute statistics of samples.

68
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:39.190
First, let us get a sample with size
10 from population, using replacement.

69
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.750
The sample and sample variance
standard deviation are printed out.

70
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.560
Notice that when we compute
a sample variance and

71
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:52.580
std, we need the ddof equal to 1.

72
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.470
It means the denominator
of a sample variance has to

73
00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.370
be n-1 instead of n,
which is the sample size.

74
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.790
To understand why the denominator
of the sample variance is n-1, let

75
00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.230
us generate 500 samples,
each sample with size equal to 50.

76
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.729
We calculate sample variance for

77
00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:23.562
each sample using n and
n-1 as denominators.

78
00:06:23.562 --> 00:06:30.145
You'll find that the real
population variance is 571.8.

79
00:06:30.145 --> 00:06:34.949
As you can see,
the average of sample variances using

80
00:06:34.949 --> 00:06:39.770
n-1 is closer to population
variance than using n.

81
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:45.806
The average of sample variance
using n as denominator is always

82
00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:51.801
smaller than population variance,
which is some mathematical reasons.

83
00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:55.951
n-1, in fact,
is called degrees of freedom.

84
00:06:55.951 --> 00:07:01.162
For sample variance,
there is another explanation why sample

85
00:07:01.162 --> 00:07:06.481
variance is divided by n-1,
which is the degrees of freedom.

86
00:07:06.481 --> 00:07:10.392
Degrees of freedom is
a number of values used in

87
00:07:10.392 --> 00:07:13.713
calculation that are free to variate.

88
00:07:13.713 --> 00:07:17.149
When we use the sample mean to
compute the sample variance,

89
00:07:17.149 --> 00:07:19.220
we will lose one degree of freedom.

90
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:23.160
For example, sample size equal to 3,

91
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:28.470
sample mean equal to 100 is used
in computing sample variance.

92
00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.700
We can choose two individuals
independently, for example,

93
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.970
90 and 80 in the table, but

94
00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:41.480
the third is not free to variate
because of constraint of sample mean.

95
00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.487
The only choice for a third number is 130.

96
00:07:47.487 --> 00:07:49.531
When we compute the variance,

97
00:07:49.531 --> 00:07:54.180
using degrees of freedom is
better than using sample size.

98
00:07:54.180 --> 00:08:00.570
In the sense that the average of estimator
will be equal to population variance,

99
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.920
which is called an unbiased estimator.

100
00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:10.130
In the next video, we will talk about
distribution of sample statistics.
